## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated physics student committed to utilizing my diverse experiences, unique background, and ambitions to gain a distinctive perspective on research. I aim to contribute to human knowledge and make it accessible to all, enabling me to communicate science and inspire others to share my passion effectively.

As a first-generation college student and the son of an immigrant from Mexico, I bring a unique and diverse perspective to physics. As a Latino male in physics, I am passionate about representing my community and helping others achieve their dreams.

I am passionate about breaking down barriers in STEM and making science accessible to everyone. My journey has instilled in me resilience, determination, and a profound appreciation for the importance of diversity in STEM. Through my studies and future endeavors, I aim to inspire and empower others, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, to pursue their interests in science and reach their full potential.

My specific areas of interest include astrophysics, astronomy, and cosmology. These fields captivate me and drive my desire to explore the universe and contribute to our understanding of the cosmos. I aim to pursue a PhD, where I can further my research and make meaningful contributions to the scientific community.
